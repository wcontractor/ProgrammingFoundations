## Take A Break
This is the first assignment in the Programming Foundations with Python course from Udacity.com.  The program uses the time and webbrowser modules.  Time is used to sleep the program for 2 hours and then webbrowser opens the default web browser on the system and plays a Youtube video.  These steps are placed in a while loop to run up to 3 times.
